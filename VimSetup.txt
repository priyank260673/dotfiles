Hello,

So I have following setup as shown yesterday to Dylan and Martin. It covers most of my IDE 
needs with very little problems. There is little bit of learning curve but can be easily 
get command of this in week or so. It will save quite a bit of development time - if 
you are just using vim without following. In my personal view - I have never lost any 
time due to problems with vim. I did invest lot of time making it effecient to use.

1) Required software
   -> vim version > 8.1. Need to open ticket.
   -> Latest ctags build (exuberent ctags for git - can be downloded and built off the web)
   -> Latest cscope build (optional)
   -> Plugins mentioned below

2) Mininum needed plugins: 
   -> Vundle (Plugin managment - how to keep plugins up-to-date)
   -> vim-airline (Statusline, gitinfo, filetype, location)
   -> vim-fugitive (Gdiff, GStatus, GBlame, Gcommit etc...)
   -> buf-explorer (easier navigation in open buffers)
   -> grep (Grep facility within open bufferso)
   -> vim-gitgutter (Git changes on sidebar)
   -> vim-colorschemes (various color schemes)
   -> tagbar (uses ctags/cscope database to show tag information)
   -> asyncrun (Asynchronous run - for example building in vim)
   -> UltiSnips (Autocompletion snippets)
   -> YouCompletMe (Intellisense like IDE, completion, linting via gcc)
      How to build? Setup needed for .ycm_extra_conf.py file
	  This is the most important part and I have sample that works for 
	  sapphire git repo (almost all of the time).

3) Ctags/Cscope integration 
   -> What command you need to build ctags for C++ 
      and sapphire codebase?
	  Use for finding certain string across codebase,
	  jumping through code where YCM might not work/very rare.

4) Key mappings 
   -> Function mapping for build in one key stroke
   -> Jumping around code 
   -> Some helpful tips, tricks during devlopment
      Splitting windows, jumping between source and implementation,
	  finding certain string across codebase etc

5) If time permits - debugging through Emacs/Vim.
   I prefer Emacs with EVIL mode - that simulates vim in Emacs.

6) Any questions? 

Thanks

======================================================================

1) Make sure you vim version is > 8.1
2) Create dirctory called .vim/bundle
3) Download following from github in bundle directory:
   git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git
4) For intelisense/completion do following:
   cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
   install.py --clang-completer
5) Copy .vimrc  in your home directory and .vimrc.plugin
6) Run BundleInstall to install all plugins
   You can run BundleUpdate to update plugins

// Tags setup
1) mkdir ~/tags/
2) Get latest ctags and build it
   https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags.git
   -> Go in the directory where ctags has downloaded.
      You might need install of pkg-config (open ticket for support group)
   -> ./autogen.sh && make;
   -> Make sure you path is pointing to this ctags
3) Run buildTags.sh

// TMUX aliases
alias tl='tmux last-window'
alias tmd='tmux detach'
alias tmk='tmux kill-session -t $1'
alias tml='tmux ls'
alias tmn='tmux -2 new -s $1'
alias tmr='tmux attach -d -t $1'
